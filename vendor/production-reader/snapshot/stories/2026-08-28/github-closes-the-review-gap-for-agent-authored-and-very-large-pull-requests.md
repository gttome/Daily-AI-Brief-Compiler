title: "GitHub closes the review gap for agent-authored and very large pull requests"
description: "GitHub expanded Copilot code review so automatically requested reviews of pull requests opened by Copilot cloud agent receive the full agentic review rather than a limited fallback. GitHub also removed the previous 300-file or 20,000-line review ceiling and added explicit resolution reasons—“Addressed,” “Won’t fix,” and “Incorrect”—for Copilot comments."

**Summary:** GitHub expanded Copilot code review so automatically requested reviews of pull requests opened by Copilot cloud agent receive the full agentic review rather than a limited fallback. GitHub also removed the previous 300-file or 20,000-line review ceiling and added explicit resolution reasons—“Addressed,” “Won’t fix,” and “Incorrect”—for Copilot comments.

**Why it matters:** Agent-generated code now receives a stronger automated review loop even when the change is unusually large. The resolution reasons are also structured evaluation data: they distinguish accepted findings from intentional exceptions and false positives. Removal of a size ceiling does not prove review completeness, so large changes still need risk-based tests and human sampling.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is a clean example of a human-gated loop: agent produces, agent reviews, tests provide independent evidence, and a person records the disposition. It can support a course exercise on designing feedback that improves both accountability and future evaluation." hidden></span>
