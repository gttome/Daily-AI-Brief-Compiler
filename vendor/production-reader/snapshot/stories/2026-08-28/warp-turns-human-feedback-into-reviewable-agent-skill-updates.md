description: "Anthropic published Warp’s pattern for self-improving agents. A task-specific base skill performs work; people leave feedback where the work already occurs; and a scheduled “improver” skill proposes a small edit to the base skill. The change moves through a normal pull-request review before becoming part of later runs. Warp says it applies the pattern to specification, review, and issue-triage agents."

**Summary:** Anthropic published Warp’s pattern for self-improving agents. A task-specific base skill performs work; people leave feedback where the work already occurs; and a scheduled “improver” skill proposes a small edit to the base skill. The change moves through a normal pull-request review before becoming part of later runs. Warp says it applies the pattern to specification, review, and issue-triage agents.

**Why it matters:** The pattern converts transient feedback into persistent, inspectable procedure without allowing the working agent to silently rewrite itself. File-based skills also support progressive disclosure: the agent loads targeted instructions and resources when needed instead of expanding every prompt.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="It closely matches the Human-Gated Agentic Work model. A reusable “improver” could periodically examine corrections to a briefing, manuscript workflow, or course-production process and propose—never silently apply—the smallest rule change." hidden></span>
