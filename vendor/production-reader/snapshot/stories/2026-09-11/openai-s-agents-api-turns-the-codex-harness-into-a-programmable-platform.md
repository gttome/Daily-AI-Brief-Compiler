# OpenAI’s Agents API turns the Codex harness into a programmable platform

<span class="story-data" data-story-id="dab-story-2026-09-11-8a71a280" hidden></span>

**Focus:** Technical AI Engineering  
**Date:** September 10, 2026  
**Topics:** agent harnesses, context compaction, tool calling, multi-agent systems  
**Evidence:** Official Announcement  
**Availability:** Beta

**Summary:** OpenAI introduced the Agents API in public beta for all developers, exposing the same managed Codex harness used by its coding products. The API supports long-running sessions with context compaction, tool search, programmatic tool calling, MCP and custom tools, multi-agent workflows, intermediate results, and execution in hosted, customer, or partner environments.

**Why it matters:** This separates agent reliability work from a one-shot model call: context, tools, environments, delegation, evidence, and failure handling become explicit harness components. Public beta still warrants staged evaluation; the announcement describes capabilities, not independent reliability results.

Prototype one bounded research or publishing workflow, log intermediate evidence, and test compaction and tool failures before considering production use." hidden></span>

### Evolving the Generative AI Professional Series

<p><strong>Reliable Generative AI Context Engineering</strong> — Proposed update: Add a layered diagram separating model, harness, tool access and evidence handoff. The reported Agents API makes the harness an explicit part of the workflow. Teaching asset: A failure-injection exercise in which a tool result or context handoff is missing.</p>

## What to do now

**Evaluate one bounded workflow:** Test a real multi-step workflow with evidence capture, tool-failure handling, and a human release gate.
