**Summary:** Google made new Gemini Enterprise for Slack interactions generally available: users can mention Gemini in a channel, receive a response privately for review, and deliberately share it back; direct messages can retain multi-turn context. Admins must reinstall the Slack app and users must reauthorize it to enable the update.

**Why it matters:** The private draft is a useful human-review boundary inside a familiar collaboration tool, reducing accidental channel publication. It does not verify the answer, and retained conversational context can carry forward errors or sensitive assumptions, so review and context-reset habits remain essential.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="Use this in non-technical agent workshops to demonstrate a safe delegation pattern: ask in context, review privately, revise, verify, then share. Include the admin and user authorization steps in rollout checklists." hidden></span>

### Evolving the Generative AI Professional Series

<p><strong>Generative AI Professional Prompt Engineering Guide</strong> — Proposed update: Add a private-draft-to-approved-share prompt pattern. The Slack workflow puts review before channel publication. Teaching asset: A reusable prompt and checklist for deciding what may be shared.</p>

## What to do now

**Test private-to-public review:** Pilot one low-risk channel workflow and document when to verify, revise, share, or clear context.
