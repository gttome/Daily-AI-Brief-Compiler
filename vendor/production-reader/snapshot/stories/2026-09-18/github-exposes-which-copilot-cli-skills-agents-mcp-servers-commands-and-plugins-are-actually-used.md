**Focus:** Technical AI Engineering  
**Date:** September 17, 2026  
**Topics:** agent observability, Copilot CLI, Agent Skills, MCP, plugins, usage metrics  
**Evidence:** Official Announcement  
**Availability:** General Availability

![Textbook diagram of Copilot CLI skills, agents, MCP servers, commands, and plugins flowing into usage and distinct-use telemetry with privacy grouping.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-18/02-cli-telemetry.png?v=e69696eeaa07df9f)

**Summary:** GitHub expanded the Copilot usage metrics API with CLI customization telemetry. Reports can now show top-used skills, custom agents, MCP servers, slash commands, and plugins plus counts of how many distinct items are being used; customer-defined names are grouped to protect privacy.

**Why it matters:** Agent customization is becoming an operational layer that needs the same observability as models and prompts. Teams can now distinguish a large catalog of configured assets from the smaller set people actually invoke, identify enablement gaps, and measure whether reusable agent components are spreading.

## What to do now

**Measure reuse before expanding the catalog:** Track which reusable agent assets are invoked, how broadly they spread, and whether high-use assets also pass quality and outcome checks before investing in more customizations.
