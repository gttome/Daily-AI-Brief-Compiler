title: "Vero benchmark shows repository-scale formal verification remains hard for coding agents"
description: "The new Vero benchmark evaluates whether AI agents can build multi-module software repositories while also producing machine-checked proofs that the implementation satisfies formal specifications. Vero contains 43 repository-level tasks spanning Python, Dafny, Verus, Coq, and Lean-based verification workflows. In the authors’ evaluation, the strongest tested agent fully solved 27 of 43 instances and failed to close specifications on the hardest repositories."

**Summary:** The new Vero benchmark evaluates whether AI agents can build multi-module software repositories while also producing machine-checked proofs that the implementation satisfies formal specifications. Vero contains 43 repository-level tasks spanning Python, Dafny, Verus, Coq, and Lean-based verification workflows. In the authors’ evaluation, the strongest tested agent fully solved 27 of 43 instances and failed to close specifications on the hardest repositories.

**Why it matters:** Passing unit tests is not the same as proving correctness. Vero pushes coding-agent evaluation toward stronger evidence by requiring implementation and formal proof to agree across an entire repository. The results also show that frontier agents still have substantial difficulty when correctness must be demonstrated rather than inferred from plausible output.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is a useful example for teaching **evaluation ladders**: syntax checks → tests → integration tests → adversarial evaluation → formal verification. Not every application needs formal methods, but the benchmark clearly illustrates why the rigor of the verification method should rise with the consequence of failure." hidden></span>
