description: "*AI4AI-Bench* tests whether agents can improve machine-learning training algorithms rather than merely tune parameters or collect more data. It freezes ten research repositories covering ten algorithm families. For each task, an agent gets four hours on one NVIDIA B300 to rewrite the training algorithm; the resulting code is then rerun from scratch for up to 12 hours and scored by a fixed evaluator hidden from the agent. Across 29 configurations of six systems on all ten tasks, the reported mean score was 0.166 and the best system reached 0.250, on a scale where the repository’s shipped algorithm is 0.1 and the stated task optimum is 1.0. Most submissions never changed how the model learned. The minority that did averaged 0.226 versus 0.126 for the rest. Increasing reasoning effort raised the share that attempted an algorithmic change from 8% to 64%, while mean score rose from 0.094 to 0.196."

**Summary:** *AI4AI-Bench* tests whether agents can improve machine-learning training algorithms rather than merely tune parameters or collect more data. It freezes ten research repositories covering ten algorithm families. For each task, an agent gets four hours on one NVIDIA B300 to rewrite the training algorithm; the resulting code is then rerun from scratch for up to 12 hours and scored by a fixed evaluator hidden from the agent. Across 29 configurations of six systems on all ten tasks, the reported mean score was 0.166 and the best system reached 0.250, on a scale where the repository’s shipped algorithm is 0.1 and the stated task optimum is 1.0. Most submissions never changed how the model learned. The minority that did averaged 0.226 versus 0.126 for the rest. Increasing reasoning effort raised the share that attempted an algorithmic change from 8% to 64%, while mean score rose from 0.094 to 0.196.

**Why it matters:** Longer agent loops and more compute can increase willingness to attempt a deeper change, but they do not guarantee a good one. The benchmark also makes the harness visible: frozen repositories, bounded compute, clean reruns, and hidden evaluators are part of the evidence—not implementation details.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is a strong case study for separating **activity from verified improvement**. A useful teaching loop is: propose a change → rebuild from a clean state → run a hidden acceptance test → compare against a fixed baseline → preserve the full evidence trail." hidden></span>
