title: "Smaller, text-based agent skills transfer better than monolithic task recipes"
description: "*Break It Down, Pass It On* compares two choices in agent skill induction: learning a recipe for an entire task versus learning skills for component subtasks, and storing those skills as text versus code. In the authors’ experiments, task-level skills mostly pushed performance below a no-memory baseline, while subtask-level skills improved it on average. Text skills transferred better than code skills. The study also defines specificity—how closely a skill matches real tasks—and abstractness—how broadly its relevance is distributed. Neither predicts success alone, but a combined skill-utility score correlates with transfer performance and can be computed from the skill and task descriptions before executing a new task."

**Summary:** *Break It Down, Pass It On* compares two choices in agent skill induction: learning a recipe for an entire task versus learning skills for component subtasks, and storing those skills as text versus code. In the authors’ experiments, task-level skills mostly pushed performance below a no-memory baseline, while subtask-level skills improved it on average. Text skills transferred better than code skills. The study also defines specificity—how closely a skill matches real tasks—and abstractness—how broadly its relevance is distributed. Neither predicts success alone, but a combined skill-utility score correlates with transfer performance and can be computed from the skill and task descriptions before executing a new task.

**Why it matters:** More stored procedures are not automatically better context. Large, overfitted recipes can interfere with new work, while compact procedural components are easier for a harness to retrieve, compose, inspect, and revise.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="For books and workshops, teach reusable AI procedures at the **subtask** level—such as gather evidence, check dates, challenge a claim, or format citations—then let the workflow compose them. Natural-language skills may also be more accessible and adaptable for non-software developers than executable code bundles." hidden></span>
