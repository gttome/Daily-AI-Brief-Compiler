**Summary:** AWS presents a multi-account agent architecture where each business unit keeps data in its own account while a central agent queries approved MCP servers through AgentCore Gateway using cross-account authorization.

**Why it matters:** Enterprise agents often need access to distributed data without centralizing everything. A gateway-plus-MCP pattern can separate agent orchestration from data ownership while preserving account boundaries and fine-grained authorization.

## What to do now

**Prototype one governed cross-boundary agent query:** Keep data ownership local, expose only a narrow MCP surface, and log every cross-account action for review.
