**Evidence:** Official Announcement  
**Availability:** Published

![Professional white-background instructional diagram showing component health, workload-driven cluster tests, observed distributed behavior, and a production readiness gate.](https://gttome.github.io/Daily-AI-Brief/briefs/images/2026-09-25/02-nvidia-adds-workload-driven-validation-for-gpu-cluster-readiness.svg?v=professional-20260925-r2)

**Summary:** NVIDIA’s Cluster Readiness Engine uses real distributed workloads across topology-aware GPU groups to test whether a cluster is actually ready for production AI workloads rather than relying only on component health checks.

**Why it matters:** AI infrastructure can look healthy while failing under real distributed load. Workload-level readiness testing gives engineering teams a stronger pre-production signal for networking, topology, collective communication, and GPU behavior.

## What to do now

**Add workload-level readiness tests before deployment:** Use representative distributed jobs to expose failures that static health checks can miss.
