title: "Small but useful study shows one explicit compliance instruction can sharply change AI-generated code"
description: "A study evaluating three Claude-family models across four SOC 2-related coding tasks found that unprompted compliance varied substantially, with reported conformance ranging from 47% to 88%. Adding a single sentence explicitly requiring SOC 2 compliance raised reported scores to 86%–100% across the tested cases and removed the insecure constructions identified in the neutral-prompt runs. The authors also found that an initial checklist-based evaluator missed real defects, underscoring the limits of simplistic automated grading."

**Summary:** A study evaluating three Claude-family models across four SOC 2-related coding tasks found that unprompted compliance varied substantially, with reported conformance ranging from 47% to 88%. Adding a single sentence explicitly requiring SOC 2 compliance raised reported scores to 86%–100% across the tested cases and removed the insecure constructions identified in the neutral-prompt runs. The authors also found that an initial checklist-based evaluator missed real defects, underscoring the limits of simplistic automated grading.

**Why it matters:** The result reinforces two reliability principles at once. First, critical constraints should be made explicit rather than assumed to be implicit in the task. Second, evaluation systems themselves can fail, so a green rubric score is not sufficient evidence that generated code is safe or compliant.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is a strong case study for structured prompts, explicit constraints, guardrails, evaluation design, and human review. It supports a practical training rule: **state non-negotiable requirements in the prompt or specification, then independently test whether they were actually satisfied.**" hidden></span>
