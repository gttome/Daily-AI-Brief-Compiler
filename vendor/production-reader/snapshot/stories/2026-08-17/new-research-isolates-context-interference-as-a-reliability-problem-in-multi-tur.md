title: "New research isolates “context interference” as a reliability problem in multi-turn search agents"
description: "The paper *Mitigating Context Interference for Reliable and Efficient Search Agents* studies how long, multi-turn retrieval workflows accumulate distracting information. The authors report that interference is driven especially by the most recently retrieved documents, then introduce a distillation-based context refiner that filters the working context before the agent generates its next step. They also report additional gains when context refinement is incorporated into reinforcement-learning training for search agents."

**Summary:** The paper *Mitigating Context Interference for Reliable and Efficient Search Agents* studies how long, multi-turn retrieval workflows accumulate distracting information. The authors report that interference is driven especially by the most recently retrieved documents, then introduce a distillation-based context refiner that filters the working context before the agent generates its next step. They also report additional gains when context refinement is incorporated into reinforcement-learning training for search agents.

**Why it matters:** This gives a concrete mechanism for a problem often described more loosely as context rot or context overload. More retrieval is not automatically better. In iterative RAG and search-agent loops, reliability depends on continuously curating the working context rather than simply appending every retrieved artifact to the prompt history.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is highly relevant to context-engineering lifecycle material. It supports teaching context management as an **iterative selection-and-refinement loop**, not a one-time prompt assembly step. It also provides a research-backed example for explaining why freshness, relevance, signal-to-noise ratio, and token budgeting must be evaluated at every agent turn." hidden></span>
