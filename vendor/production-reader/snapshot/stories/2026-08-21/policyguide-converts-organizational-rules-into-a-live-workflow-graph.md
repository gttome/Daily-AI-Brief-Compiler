**Summary:** *PolicyGuide* compiles a domain policy into a workflow graph, persists the graph’s state across a conversation, and runs a verifier at user-turn boundaries. The verifier checks both prohibited actions and required steps that might otherwise be omitted, then returns remediation along a compliant path. On the airline, retail, and telecom domains of τ²-bench, the authors report that mean Pass⁴ rose from 0.42 to 0.62 with GPT-5.4; telecom improved from 0.19 to 0.61. The same workflows transferred to Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Gemini 2.5 Pro agents.

**Why it matters:** Most runtime guardrails judge one proposed action. PolicyGuide addresses a harder problem: whether the **whole sequence** followed the policy. Its graph makes open requests, completed requirements, and permitted next steps explicit, which is useful for long-running agents and auditable human escalation.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This is a direct bridge between graph engineering and reliable Generative AI. Training material can show how policy text becomes nodes, conditions, state transitions, verification gates, and human-review points—turning “follow policy” from a prompt into an inspectable system." hidden></span>
