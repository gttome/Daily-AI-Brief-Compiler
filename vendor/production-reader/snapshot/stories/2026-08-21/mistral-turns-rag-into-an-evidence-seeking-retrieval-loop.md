title: "Mistral turns RAG into an evidence-seeking retrieval loop"
description: "Mistral introduced **Agentic Search**, a retrieval layer that lets a model repeatedly search, open, navigate, read, and grep indexed documents instead of answering from one fixed set of chunks. It is available through Mistral Search Toolkit and through Libraries in Studio and Vibe, with cloud and on-premises deployment options. In Mistral’s tests, the complete loop raised GLM-5.2 accuracy on FinanceBench from 26.7% to 86.0% and on OfficeQA Pro from 6.3% to 51.9%. Navigation also reduced token use by as much as one-third and cut FinanceBench p90 latency from 255 to 154 seconds."

**Summary:** Mistral introduced **Agentic Search**, a retrieval layer that lets a model repeatedly search, open, navigate, read, and grep indexed documents instead of answering from one fixed set of chunks. It is available through Mistral Search Toolkit and through Libraries in Studio and Vibe, with cloud and on-premises deployment options. In Mistral’s tests, the complete loop raised GLM-5.2 accuracy on FinanceBench from 26.7% to 86.0% and on OfficeQA Pro from 6.3% to 51.9%. Navigation also reduced token use by as much as one-third and cut FinanceBench p90 latency from 255 to 154 seconds.

**Why it matters:** This is a practical shift from one-shot RAG to **retrieve → inspect → refine → verify**. The tool surface is deliberately small, but it gives the model enough control to follow references, inspect tables, and recover from weak first results. It also makes the retrieval trace easier to inspect than an opaque, single-pass answer.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This provides a clean teaching contrast between **traditional RAG** and **agentic retrieval**. A workshop can have learners diagnose when a direct lookup is sufficient and when a bounded search loop is justified. Because Libraries exposes the feature in Studio and Vibe, it is also relevant to non-software developers building grounded assistants." hidden></span>
