# Codex 0.151 makes subagent cost and restored permissions more visible

![A root coding agent branching to three subagents whose usage is recorded in a ledger beside a permission lock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-08-31/02-codex-harness-ledger.svg)

**Summary:** OpenAI’s Codex CLI `rust-v0.151.0` release accounts subagent token use against root goals, preserves restored permission profiles in TUI sessions, reports which capabilities remote plugin syncs affect, and adds telemetry around escalated stdin reviews and remote-executor MCP discovery. The release also includes test stabilization.

**Why it matters:** Multi-agent systems hide cost and authority in branches. Rolling child-agent usage into the parent goal improves budget attribution, while preserving and surfacing permissions reduces ambiguity after a session is restored. This is a maintenance release, not a model-capability leap, and telemetry is useful only if teams review it and set thresholds.
