![Claude Cowork choosing connectors first, browser second, and direct computer use as the higher-risk fallback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-06/06-cowork-computer-use.svg?v=20260906-1)

**Summary:** Anthropic’s Cowork documentation, updated this week, describes a practical tool-selection hierarchy for delegated work. Cowork prefers direct connectors when available, falls back to browser interaction when needed, and can use direct computer interaction—clicking, typing, opening apps, and navigating the screen—when no more precise tool is available. Anthropic explicitly notes that screen interaction is slower and more error-prone than connectors and recommends monitoring computer-use tasks, especially early on.

**Why it matters:** This is a strong reliability pattern for non-technical agents: use the narrowest, most structured tool that can complete the task, and escalate to more flexible interfaces only when necessary. The broader the interface, the larger the error and security surface. Tool choice is therefore part of the agent’s risk model, not merely a convenience decision.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="Incorporate “least-flexible sufficient tool” into agent governance. It maps cleanly to the AI Authority Ladder: connector actions can be tightly bounded, browser actions need more observation, and direct computer use warrants still stronger review for consequential workflows." hidden></span>
