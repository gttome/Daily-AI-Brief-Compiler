**Topics:** agent deployment, resources as code, reproducibility, skills, memory, environments, approval plans  
**Evidence:** Unspecified  
**Availability:** Unspecified

![Declarative agent files flowing through ant apply into reviewed, stable agent resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-06/02-ant-apply.svg?v=20260906-1)

**Summary:** Anthropic’s September 3 platform release added `ant apply` to the `ant` CLI. Developers can describe agents, environments, skills, memory stores, and deployments in repository files, generate a proposed change plan, approve it, and commit a lockfile so later runs update the same resources instead of silently creating new ones. The pattern imports familiar infrastructure-as-code ideas into agent engineering.

**Why it matters:** Agent systems are becoming complex enough that manual configuration is a reliability risk. Declarative definitions, reviewed plans, stable resource identity, and version-controlled configuration make agent environments easier to reproduce, audit, roll back, and move through CI/CD. This is a concrete sign that agent engineering is converging with mature software and infrastructure operations.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="Add “agent resources as code” to harness-engineering material. It provides a strong bridge from prompts and context into operational reliability: version the agent, its skills, memory resources, and environment together, then review proposed changes before deployment." hidden></span>
