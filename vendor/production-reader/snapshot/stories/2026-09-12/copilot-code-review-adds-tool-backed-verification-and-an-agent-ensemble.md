**Focus:** Technical AI Engineering  
**Date:** September 11, 2026  
**Topics:** AI-assisted code review, tool use, agent ensembles, verification  
**Evidence:** Official Changelog  
**Availability:** General Availability

![Radial code-review verification diagram in which specialist review agents use shell tools behind a firewall, merge findings into a review ledger, and separate addressed comments from still-open work.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-12/01-copilot-review-verification.png?v=20260912textbook)

**Summary:** GitHub expanded Copilot code review so its review agent can use the Copilot SDK’s shell tools behind the Copilot agent firewall to run builds, tests, targeted scripts, and available APIs. Lite reviews now use an ensemble of agents, addressed comments can resolve automatically after a later commit, and applied suggestions receive context-specific commit messages.

**Why it matters:** The engineering pattern is verification inside the review harness: several perspectives can inspect a change and execute checks before presenting one consolidated result. GitHub reports that its ensemble experiment increased addressed comments per review by 47% for high-severity findings, 31% for medium, and 11% for low while reducing cost about 8%; these are vendor experiments, not independent measures of defect-removal accuracy.

Require generated changes to expose checks run, unresolved findings, and a human acceptance decision instead of treating an agent’s prose as proof." hidden></span><!-- reader-release:start -->

## What to do now

**Test the verification loop:** Compare a bounded pull-request set with and without executable checks, then inspect false positives and missed defects.
