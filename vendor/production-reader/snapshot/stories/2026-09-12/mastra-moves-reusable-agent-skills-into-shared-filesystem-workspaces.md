**Focus:** Agents for Non-Technical People  
**Date:** September 11, 2026  
**Topics:** Agent Skills, SKILL.md, shared workspaces, sandbox permissions  
**Evidence:** Official Documentation  
**Availability:** General Availability

![Layered filesystem-skills cutaway separating per-agent, shared, and isolated skill stores, SKILL.md instructions, references and scripts, mount boundaries, on-demand retrieval, sandbox execution, and human review.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-12/05-mastra-filesystem-skills.png?v=20260912textbook)

**Summary:** Mastra added filesystem skills to Workspaces in core version 1.66.0 or later. Teams can store SKILL.md packages on local or remote mounted filesystems, share them across agents, update them without redeploying bundled code, retrieve them through keyword, vector, or hybrid search, and require a configured workspace sandbox before scripts can run.

**Why it matters:** This separates reusable procedure from the model and from application deployment, while keeping storage mounts and executable authority explicit. It also introduces operational obligations: version and review skill changes, restrict mounts, control who may edit shared stores, and treat script execution as a higher-risk capability. The evidence is product documentation, not an independent reliability evaluation.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="Package one stable research or publishing procedure as a small skill with instructions, references, and an optional reviewed script. Test the same skill with two agents, keep the writable scope narrow, and assign a human owner for updates." hidden></span>

## What to do now

**Share one bounded skill:** Mount one reviewed skill read-only, test search behavior, and require approval before any script execution.
