**Focus:** Technical AI Engineering  
**Date:** September 11, 2026  
**Topics:** agent observability, usage metrics, adoption measurement, data availability  
**Evidence:** Official Changelog  
**Availability:** General Availability

![Isometric observability cutaway tracing VS Code agent-window activity through a policy gate into one-day, twenty-eight-day, aggregate, and per-user reports, with unavailable fields explicitly marked null.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-12/02-vscode-agent-metrics.png?v=20260912textbook)

**Summary:** GitHub added generally available VS Code Agents-window fields to Copilot usage reports for one-day and 28-day periods. Aggregate reports can expose active users, sessions, and user messages; user-level reports can expose whether the window was used plus session and message totals. The optional fields remain absent or null when data is unavailable.

**Why it matters:** Agent adoption needs a defined measurement boundary. GitHub explicitly separates the dedicated Agents window from editor Agent Mode and generic usage rollups, which reduces misleading comparisons. These fields measure activity, not task quality, business value, safety, or correctness, and access depends on enabled policy and authorized roles.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="For consulting dashboards, label the surface, time window, population, and missing-data semantics. Pair adoption counts with completed-work evidence, review outcomes, and qualitative failure notes before drawing an ROI conclusion." hidden></span>

## What to do now

**Separate activity from outcomes:** Instrument agent surfaces distinctly and add task-quality measures before interpreting adoption.
