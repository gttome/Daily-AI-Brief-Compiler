**Summary:** LlamaIndex argues that extraction reliability often fails at the schema layer: each field asserts meaning, cardinality and applicability across a document population. Making a non-universal field required can become a standing instruction for a model to invent a value.

**Why it matters:** Teams can improve extraction by reviewing field meaning, optionality and nullability as carefully as prompts or model choice. The guidance is practitioner analysis, so every schema still needs evaluation on its own document population.

## What to do now

**Audit one extraction schema:** For every required field, ask whether all source documents contain exactly one grounded answer; make exceptions optional before evaluating the model.
