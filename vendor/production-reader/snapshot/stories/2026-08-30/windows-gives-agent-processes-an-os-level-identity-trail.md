![Windows agent process receiving a protected identity that survives child processes and authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-08-30/01-process-identity.svg)

**Summary:** Microsoft’s optional Windows 11 preview update KB5120998 introduces two agent-oriented platform features. Microsoft Execution Containers add a lightweight policy boundary that can restrict files, networking, the user interface, and other OS capabilities for workloads such as coding agents and model-generated code. Separately, authorized components can attach an opaque agent identifier to a process token; Windows protects the marker, passes it to child processes, and includes it when the process authenticates through Web Account Manager.

**Why it matters:** This moves agent governance below the application harness. A durable process identity can support attribution across subprocesses, while policy-based containment can reduce the blast radius of generated code. Important limits remain: the identity support is explicitly a preview whose format may change, the update rolls out gradually, and Microsoft does not describe it as a complete security boundary for every agent threat.
