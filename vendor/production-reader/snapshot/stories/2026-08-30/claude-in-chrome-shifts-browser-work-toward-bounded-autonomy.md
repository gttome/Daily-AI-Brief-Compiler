description: "Anthropic made Claude in Chrome generally available to users on paid Claude plans. The extension can read pages, type, click, navigate, and complete forms using the user’s existing browser logins. It now uses an action-safety classifier to decide when an action can proceed autonomously rather than asking for approval every time; users can restore manual approval for every action."

**Summary:** Anthropic made Claude in Chrome generally available to users on paid Claude plans. The extension can read pages, type, click, navigate, and complete forms using the user’s existing browser logins. It now uses an action-safety classifier to decide when an action can proceed autonomously rather than asking for approval every time; users can restore manual approval for every action.

**Why it matters:** This puts multi-step delegation inside a familiar subscription product without code or API keys. It also raises the stakes: browser content can contain prompt injection, and a logged-in browser carries real authority. Anthropic reports improved detection in its evaluations, but those are vendor-run tests, not a guarantee against unseen attacks. Users should begin with low-stakes, reversible tasks and keep approval enabled for consequential actions.
