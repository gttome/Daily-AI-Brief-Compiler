**Summary:** *Metrics That Write Themselves* proposes EvalCEGAR, a loop that searches for pairs of answers an existing evaluator scores identically even though one is correct and the other is not. Those counterexamples become the specification for a small Python operator that detects one named defect or abstains. On MBPP+ and HumanEval+, the system produced a 55-line operator that closed 15.4% of the gap between flagging nothing and a perfect filter on 428 unseen tasks. Six of eight runs admitted a useful operator, and all six improved out-of-sample filtering.

**Why it matters:** Many Generative AI applications fail because teams cannot define a complete metric in advance. EvalCEGAR treats evaluator development as a diagnostic loop: find a blind spot, express it as a counterexample, add a narrow executable check, and test whether it generalizes. This can complement rather than replace human rubrics or LLM judges.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This offers a concrete evaluation-engineering pattern for books and workshops: **baseline rubric → find indistinguishable good/bad examples → add one narrow check → regression test → retain only if it helps unseen cases**. It makes evaluation iteration more tangible for knowledge workers than asking an AI to “improve the rubric” generically." hidden></span>
