description: "AWS published production guidance for Amazon Quick Automate, its multi-agent business-process automation capability. The guidance recommends starting from a well-understood process, assigning each agent one coherent responsibility, scoping tools and outputs, and mixing agentic judgment with deterministic steps rather than letting a model reason about everything. It also emphasizes human review for consequential decisions, unit testing individual agents, execution-level observability, and deliberate identity choices for attended versus unattended work."

![Business agent workflow combining bounded agents, deterministic steps, human review, evaluation, and observability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gttome/Daily-AI-Brief/main/briefs/images/2026-09-05/05-quick-automate.svg?v=20260905-1)

**Summary:** AWS published production guidance for Amazon Quick Automate, its multi-agent business-process automation capability. The guidance recommends starting from a well-understood process, assigning each agent one coherent responsibility, scoping tools and outputs, and mixing agentic judgment with deterministic steps rather than letting a model reason about everything. It also emphasizes human review for consequential decisions, unit testing individual agents, execution-level observability, and deliberate identity choices for attended versus unattended work.

**Why it matters:** This is a useful mainstream pattern for moving agentic automation beyond demos. The key design idea is that reliable automation is hybrid: agents handle ambiguous inputs and contextual judgment, while fixed rules handle calculations, thresholds, routing, and situations where improvisation is undesirable. That combination makes business automation easier to test, explain, govern, and maintain.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This maps almost directly to Bounded Agentic Delegation and the AI Authority Ladder. Use an invoice or onboarding example to show when to let an agent interpret, when to force a deterministic step, where to add human approval, and how to evaluate the workflow after deployment." hidden></span>
