title: "NVIDIA draws a hard line between behavioral guidance and enforceable agent security"
description: "NVIDIA’s security teams propose a layered agent stack in which prompts, models, and harness logic influence behavior, while a secure runtime and infrastructure enforce identity, policy, isolation, credentials, and audit. Their governing rule is that components above the boundary may propose actions, but only the authoritative environment below it decides what can occur. The guidance identifies recurring gaps: unclear boundaries, excessive standing access, untrusted data influencing control, uncontrolled external effects, cascading delegation failures, and incomplete audit evidence. It recommends checking every consequential effect, using short-lived task-scoped access, isolating each agent, and retaining independent records below the agent boundary."

**Summary:** NVIDIA’s security teams propose a layered agent stack in which prompts, models, and harness logic influence behavior, while a secure runtime and infrastructure enforce identity, policy, isolation, credentials, and audit. Their governing rule is that components above the boundary may propose actions, but only the authoritative environment below it decides what can occur. The guidance identifies recurring gaps: unclear boundaries, excessive standing access, untrusted data influencing control, uncontrolled external effects, cascading delegation failures, and incomplete audit evidence. It recommends checking every consequential effect, using short-lived task-scoped access, isolating each agent, and retaining independent records below the agent boundary.

**Why it matters:** A prompt telling an agent to behave safely is not a security control. Reliable systems need restrictions the model cannot rewrite, ignore, or route around.

It can connect the AI Authority Ladder to a concrete technical architecture: the harness guides behavior, while infrastructure enforces the approved authority ceiling." hidden></span>
