title: "OpenAI’s planned Cursor cutoff exposes model-provider concentration risk"
description: "OpenAI says it notified SpaceX that it intends to wind down the contract supplying OpenAI models to Cursor, proposing November 12, 2026 as the shutoff date after SpaceX’s acquisition of Cursor. OpenAI also says it will not provide Cursor with future models, including its upcoming Astra model. These are OpenAI’s stated contractual and safety reasons; the announcement does not include Cursor or SpaceX’s response."

**Summary:** OpenAI says it notified SpaceX that it intends to wind down the contract supplying OpenAI models to Cursor, proposing November 12, 2026 as the shutoff date after SpaceX’s acquisition of Cursor. OpenAI also says it will not provide Cursor with future models, including its upcoming Astra model. These are OpenAI’s stated contractual and safety reasons; the announcement does not include Cursor or SpaceX’s response.

**Why it matters:** AI-assisted development products inherit availability, policy, and commercial risk from upstream model providers. A strong coding harness should therefore separate model-specific features from core workflow logic, maintain tested alternatives, and document what degrades when a provider disappears. “Multi-model” only counts as resilience if fallback paths are exercised before an incident.
