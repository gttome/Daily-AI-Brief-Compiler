**Summary:** *Can Agent Memory Systems Track Evolving State?* introduces StateMemBench, 234 multi-session scenarios in which facts, constraints, and decisions change over time. Its grading distinguishes answers based on the current state from answers that repeat a superseded state. The authors report that conventional memory, retrieval, and long-context baselines struggle with this distinction. Their StateMem method explicitly records supersession and relational dependencies. The paper reports current-state accuracy increasing from 0.205 to 0.363 on DeepSeek-V4-Flash and from 0.149 to 0.233 over the strongest comparison memory system on Qwen-3.5-9B. A single-call wrapper produced much larger gains across six backends, while matched controls attributed a substantial part of the improvement to the state structure rather than merely adding more context.

**Why it matters:** Retrieval systems often optimize for finding a relevant past statement even when that statement is no longer valid. Reliable long-running agents need memory that can represent relationships such as **replaced by**, **depends on**, and **currently active**.

<span class="story-editorial-note" data-george-implication="This directly strengthens the distinction among session, project, and memory context. A practical rule is: do not merely append a changed decision—mark the prior decision as superseded, record the active replacement, and verify which state the AI used before it acts." hidden></span>
