**Summary:** NVIDIA describes an evaluation approach that tests whether agents complete multi-step work in executable environments, tracking state across sequences of tool calls instead of judging isolated function invocations.

**Why it matters:** An agent can make individually valid tool calls and still fail the job. Production evaluation therefore needs end-to-end task outcomes, environment state, recovery behavior, and repeatability—not only model-level or single-call accuracy.

## What to do now

**Add end-to-end agent tests:** Create representative tasks with executable environments and score completion, state changes, recovery, and final outcomes rather than isolated calls.
