**Evidence:** Official Announcement  
**Availability:** Published

![Professional editorial diagram used for the September 22 agent security story, showing isolated execution, sandbox boundaries, policy controls, and protected data flows.](https://gttome.github.io/Daily-AI-Brief/briefs/images/2026-09-22/06-multitenant-agent-security.png?v=c6735dd73cdad04d)

**Summary:** AWS describes how Benchling runs AI agent-generated scientific code using AgentCore Code Interpreter in VPC mode, combining network isolation, DNS controls, and endpoint policies to reduce cross-tenant and data-exfiltration risk.

**Why it matters:** As agents gain the ability to write and run code, the key design assumption should be that generated code is untrusted. Security has to come from containment, least privilege, network controls, tenancy boundaries, and observable execution—not confidence in the model.

## What to do now

**Treat agent code as untrusted:** Place code-executing agents behind isolated runtimes, least-privilege policies, outbound network controls, tenant boundaries, and audit logs.
